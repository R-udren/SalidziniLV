# Project: Cost Analysis Program

This project involves creating a program that performs cost analysis for a specific product upon user request. The analysis includes a visual representation in a chart and an Excel table. The data analysis is performed for all stores on the salÄ«dzini.lv platform.

## Features

- Visual representation of cost analysis in a chart.
- Detailed cost analysis in an Excel table, including product name, store, and price in ascending order of cost.
- Analysis of price dependency on the store.

## Libraries Used

- **openpyxl**: A Python library for working with Excel files. It allows the creation, modification, and reading of Excel files from a Python program. In this project, it is used to create a new Excel file, add tables, insert data values, and configure the layout.

- **BeautifulSoup**: A library for extracting information from HTML documents. It offers convenient methods for data navigation and quick access to desired information using class, ID, or other attributes search.

- **Matplotlib**: A popular Python library for data visualization. It offers a flexible and powerful set of tools for creating various charts, diagrams, and visualizations to help analyze and interpret data.
